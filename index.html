    <h1 class="font">Personal Information</H1>
      <p class="right">My name is Yumna Rashid, and my student ID is s3975399. I am an Australian citizen; however, I was born in Pakistan (Karachi), and my religion is Islam. I moved to Australia approximately 15 years ago, in 2008. My qualifications are HSC (grade 12) in computer science from Pakistan in 2006, then I resumed my studies in Melbourne when my kids started school, did dual certificate 3 in commercial cookery and patisserie in 2015, then certificate 4 in education support 2020, and am now enrolled in bachelor of IT with RMIT university online. I am a full-time working housewife who lives with my husband and three children. As a teaching aide, I work at a public school. I speak two languages, English and Urdu (Pakistan's national language), and I can read three languages (English, Urdu and Arabic) My interest is cake designing and baking, and it's a weird truth that when I have a headache or am feeling down, as soon as I start baking, I feel wonderful and energised. I also have a Facebook page " Yumna patisserie," where I take orders for cakes and bakery items. My favourite sport is cricket. In my spare time, I enjoy watching thriller/horror or comedy films and baking.</p>

     <h1 class="font">Interest in IT</h1>
     <p>In IT, my interest is in cyber security in particular, and I am also very interested in learning how to make mobile apps (software developer). My interest in IT began when I was in grade 10, and I wanted to do a bachelor's degree in IT (back in 2004) and work for Microsoft (my childhood funny dream), but now I have a clear vision of what I want to do. Choosing RMIT online is the greatest selection since RMIT university offers extremely flexible learning and is more convenient than other university options I explore because they have recorded sessions and no particular time to conduct online activities. My expectations for studying at RMIT are that I will go from beginner to expert in every topic I select, and I am confident that with the guidance and support of RMIT's outstanding team and brilliant lecturers, I will achieve my goals.</p>

     <h1 class="font"> Project Idea </h1>
     <p>My project idea is to create a (IOS) smartphone app (cybersecurity App in particular) that can detect online threats, conflict, or any bullying stuff through messaging (rude words detection) and block them up OR immediately report to the cybersecurity authorities from their device to prevent cyberbullying (something like that) so parents can keep track of what is going on with their kids, that app should be free to download so anyone can benefit, especially our younger generation. Essentially, my project concept is to build an App that provides a wide range of cybersecurity solutions to protect every child (ages 1- 16+) in today's society from cyberbullying difficulties. Swift would be the programming language I would use for this project, as well as HTML/CSS (if required). I would use XCode to create the app because it is an iOS app, and Microsoft Access for the database. To construct this App, I must first download XCode and correctly study Swift (code language) with XCode, and then hopefully through mutual conversations with my group members and teacher/mentor, I can create this.</p>

     <h1 class="font">Ideal Job</h1>
     <p>They are searching for a mobile app developer that has knowledge of SCRUM methodology, a decent grasp of SEO, knowledge of WCAG requirements, and hands-on expertise with contemporary JavaScript frameworks, HTML5 and /CSS3. This job looks interesting to me because my area of interest is developing mobile/smartphone apps, and it is a mobile app developer job. I am currently learning HTML and CSS, and in the description, they asked for those requirements as well, but I have a long way to go to get this job, and I hope I can achieve it by learning more skills that are mentioned in the job description, such as SCRUM methodology, a good understanding of SEO, and knowledge of WCAG.</p>

      <h1 class="font">Personal profile</h1>
      <p>I took three personality tests for myself here, and they are pretty true in terms of my temperament and personality. I am a person that is highly focused and does not waste time. I always have a smile on my face, even when dealing with pompous people; it's in my nature. I am also a really soft-hearted person, and another odd fact about me is that I can't sit for long periods of time. I am used to doing some type of job or standing, but I just can't sit for long periods of time. I am technically a hardworking lady as well (people say that about me), but that does not mean that I am overconfident. Whenever someone compliments me, I always say, "No, I always keep trying more to do things better/improve myself more," rather than, "Yes, you are correct. I am perfect," to show that I am not overconfident. </p>
