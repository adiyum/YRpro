     <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
     <p>In IT my interest is in cyber security in particular and I am also very keen to learn how to make mobile apps, my interest in IT starts when I was in my grade 10 that time, I want to do bachelors in IT (back in 2004) and want to work in Microsoft (my childhood funny dream) but now I have a clear version of what I am going to do. Choosing RMIT online is the best decision because RMIT university offers very flexible learning and according to my tough routine it is very convenient then other university options I consider they have recorded sessions and no specific time to do online exercises too. My expectations in regard to study with RMIT is a journey from basic to Pro in every subject I choose.</p>

     <h1> Project Idea </h1>
     <p>My project idea is to develop a smartphone app by using MIT App inventor to create cybersecurity app that can detect online conflict through messaging (rude words detection) and block them up from their device immediately to prevent cyberbullying something like that that app should be free to download so anyone can benefit especially our younger generations that spend plenty of their time on internet. Programming language I would use in this project is HTML/CSS. Software for developing? And I will use Microsoft access as a database.</p>
