     <h1 class="font">Interest in IT</h1>
     <p>In IT my interest is in cyber security in particular and I am also very keen to learn how to make mobile apps, my interest in IT starts when I was in my grade 10 that time, I want to do bachelors in IT (back in 2004) and want to work in Microsoft (my childhood funny dream) but now I have a clear version of what I am going to do. Choosing RMIT online is the best decision because RMIT university offers very flexible learning and according to my tough routine it is very convenient then other university options I consider they have recorded sessions and no specific time to do online exercises too. My expectations in regard to study with RMIT is a journey from basic to Pro in every subject I choose, and I am sure with the help and support of RMIT‚Äôs amazing team and brilliant teachers I will make my dreams come true.</p>

     <h1 class="font"> Project Idea </h1>
     <p>My project idea is to develop a (IOS) smartphone app (cybersecurity App in particular) that can detect online threats, conflict or any bulling stuff through messaging (rude words detection) and block them up OR immediately report to the cybersecurity authorities from their device to prevent cyberbullying (something like that) so parents can keep track on what is going on with their kids, that app should be free to download so anyone can benefit especially our younger generations that spend plenty of their time on internet for their educational/ games purposes. Basically, my project idea is launching an App that offers wide range of cybersecurity options to prevent every child (ages 1- 16+) from cyberbullying problems in today‚Äôs world. Programming language I would use in this project would be swift, also HTML/CSS (if required). Software for developing the App I would use XCode because it‚Äôs an IOS App and for database I will use Microsoft access. For creating this App first, I have to download XCode and learn swift (coding language) properly along with XCode then with mutual discussions with my group mates and teacher/ mentor I can create this hopefully.</p>

      <h1 class="font">Personal profile</h1>
      <p>Here I did three personality tests for myself, and they are very accurate according to my nature and my personality. I am very on the point, focused and no time wasters kind of person. I always carry smile on my face even with arrogant ones as well that is my inbuild nature I am very soft hearted person too and one more interesting thing about me is I cant sit for long time I am used to do some kind of work or stand I just cant sit for long time I found it that I am wasting my time and mostly I start some kind of work or shores I am technically a hardworking lady as well (people say that not me) but that does not mean that I am overconfident whenever someone praise me I always say (no I always keep try more to do things better / improve myself more) instead of saying that yes I am perfect you are rightüòä </p>
